this package is our submission for assigmnemts 2&3.

HOW TO USE
catkin_make
launch the robot (gazeo/real robot)
then:
1. rosrun ass2 kinect_proc.py
2. rosrun ass2 Controller.py

it is adviced that kinect_proc.py will run on the same machine as the robot as it is listening to PointCloud which sends large messages over the net (will be slow).

the Controller will require input as defined in the assignemt. the following commands are supported:
1 - will move ~1 meter (if no obstacles are directly infront of the robot)
2 - will rotate in place a gien amount of degrees.
3 - will return the distance to the largest red object in the frame - ASSUMES THERE IS ATLEAST ONE RED OBJECT IN THE ROBOT'S FRAME
4 - will move the robot towards the largest red object in the frame - ASSUMES THERE IS ATLEAST ONE RED OBJECT IN THE ROBOT'S FRAME
5 - will send the arm towards the largest red object in the frame - ASSUMES THERE IS ATLEAST ONE RED OBJECT IN THE ROBOT'S FRAME
